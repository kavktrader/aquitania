Philosofy:
---------

- To be a thinker means to go by the factual evidence of a case, not by the judgment of others.
- As there is no group stomach to digest collectively, there is no group mind to think collectively.
- Each man must accept responsibility for his own life, each must be sovereign by his own judgment.
- If a man believes a claim to be true, then he must hold to this belief even though society opposes him.
- Not only know what you want, but be willing to break all established conventions to accomplish it.
- The merit of a design is the only credential that you require.
